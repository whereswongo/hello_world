# About
I'm a sophomore computer science major here at the University of Rhode Island. I'm apart of BOND (Brother on a New Direction), NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) and DIVE (Diversifying Individuals Via Eduction) here on campus. My personal interests include music, specifically hip-hop and r&b, basketball, football, TV dramas and mysteries, poetry and writing as a whole. I also have a editorial internship with the famed hip-hop website 2DopeBoyz, where I've created over 100 posts for them in the past 6 months.
